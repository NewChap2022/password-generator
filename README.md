# Password Generator Starter Code

## Object 
create an application that a user generate a random password based on selected criteria.

## Criteria
- [x] Can choose minimum length and maximum length of the password.
- [x] Can choose whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- [x] At least one of the character type should be selected
- [x] A password will be generated to meet the selected criteria
- [x] The password will be displayed either in an alert or written to the page 

## Reflection
The best way to learn something new is to use it. Through creating the password generator, I gain deeper understanding of javascript by using 'while', 'if' and others. It also inspires me to learn more about how to interact html and javascript in the future. Then I can upgrade this password generator.
